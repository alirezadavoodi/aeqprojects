main method: src->aequilibrium->Main.java

Worked Done:
1- Design and Implementation of the project
2- Adding some test units: testcases package

In addition to the assumptions described in the project description, I have 
made the following assumptions:

1- I have made this assumption that, it is possible to build a castle at the end of the land too.
for instance for this input [1,2,1], 3 castles are possible
and for this input [1,2,2], 2 castles are possible
